# React Dog Facts useEffect Hook Exercise

For this weeks practice you will practice using the useEffect hook to create a simple app that will use an external free API to retrieve Dog Facts.

"The better I get to know men, the more I find myself loving dogs." - Charles de Gaulle


## Instructions:
Fetch the data from the Dog Facts free API JSON File and pass down the data from the parent component to its child component.  We've created the necessary components for you, now it's up to you to pass the prop properly to the `DogFact.jsx` component. Keep in mind that this exercise's repository `styles.css` is empty, and feel free to add CSS if you'd likeâ€”it's encouraged! The primary focus here remains to master the useEffect hook and efficiently passing data received from the API into different components via props in React.
